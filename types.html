                    <h1>Plain Weave</h1>
                    <p>Plain weave fabric is the plainest of fabric weaves.
                         It is the simplest of the three basic textile weaves, 
                         which include plain, satin, and twill. Plain weaves are 
                         also known as calico waeve, linen weave, tabby weave, basic weave or taffeta weave.
                          Straightforward in its makeup, it has the warp and weft threads passing over and under each other.
                           This tutorial will discuss the types of plain weave fabrics as well as its variations and alternatives.</p><br>

                    <h1>Satin Weave</h1>
                    <p>Satin weave refers to the way the fibers of a fabric are woven. 
                        If you check the labels on some apparel like nightgowns, wedding gowns,
                         lingerie, and blouses, you're likely to see satin listed as the fabric used.
                          While it's a popular fabric for many female clothes, satin can also be used to
                           make male clothing like boxer shorts, neckties, and shirts.</p><br>

                    <h1>Twill Weave</h1>
                    <p>The twill weave is defined by its diagonal pattern created by the way the weft
                         thread is taken over two or more warp threads.  Denim fabric is a typical example
                          of twill weaving and it is easy to see on denim because of the two colors used in the weave. 
                           The blue or indigo, and the unbleached or cream threads used to weave the denim and create the twill weave pattern.
                            The twill pattern adds texture to the fabric and as well as making it more durable. </p><br>
